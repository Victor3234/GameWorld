                <h2>About Game</h2>
                <p>Fortnite's primary game mode is a battle royale, where 100 players are dropped onto an island and compete to be the last person or team standing. The shrinking storm circle forces players into encounters, creating intense and strategic gameplay.

                    Building Mechanic: One of Fortnite's defining features is its building mechanic, which allows players to harvest materials from the environment and construct structures such as walls, ramps, and towers. This adds an extra layer of strategy and creativity to battles.
                    
                    Art Style: Fortnite features a colorful and whimsical art style that sets it apart from other battle royale games. The game's quirky aesthetic, emotes, and character skins contribute to its unique personality.
                    
                    Regular Updates: Epic Games is known for its commitment to providing regular updates and content additions to keep the game fresh. These updates include new weapons, items, limited-time modes, and in-game events that often tie into pop culture phenomena.
                    
                    Cosmetics and Battle Pass: Fortnite's monetization model centers around the sale of cosmetic items, including character skins, emotes, and pickaxes. The Battle Pass system allows players to unlock a variety of rewards by completing challenges and leveling up during each season.
                    
                    Cross-Platform Play: Fortnite supports cross-platform play, allowing players on different gaming platforms to play together and share progress seamlessly.
                    
                    Collaborations: Fortnite has featured numerous collaborations with other brands, including crossovers with popular movies, TV shows, and musicians. These collaborations have introduced special in-game events and exclusive content.
                    
                    Creative Mode: In addition to the battle royale mode, Fortnite offers a Creative mode where players can build and design their custom maps, game modes, and experiences. This mode has fostered a vibrant community of content creators.</p>
